### 👋 Hello there,

I'm a Software Engineer focused on creating clean, efficient solutions.
Previously worked as a **Data Science Intern**, and now stepping into the world of **Machine Learning**.
Worked on web applications like `TravelNest`, built using the **MERN** stack (pinned).
Currently, I'm exploring how intelligence and code converge, while working as a SWE.
